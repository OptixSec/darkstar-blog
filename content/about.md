I'm **Darkstar**, a 35-year-old tech enthusiast with a thirst for knowledge in computer-related fields. My diverse background spans hardware, software development, operating systems, and cybersecurity, allowing me to explore multiple facets of the IT world.

When I'm not exploring the latest technology trends, you can find me indulging in my passion for music. A self-proclaimed audiophile, I enjoy a wide range of genres from classical to electronic to black metal. However, Trance music has truly captured my heart â€“ a love affair that's been burning bright for eight years.

As a hobbyist music producer and DJ, I enjoy expressing myself through music by curating sets that showcase the sounds and styles that I love.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Darkstar, a 35-year-old tech enthusiast with a thirst for knowledge in computer-related fields. My diverse background spans hardware, software development, operating systems, and cybersecurity, allowing me to explore multiple facets of the IT world.&#xA;When I&amp;rsquo;m not exploring the latest technology trends, you can find me indulging in my passion for music. A self-proclaimed audiophile, I enjoy a wide range of genres from classical to electronic to black metal. However, Trance music has truly captured my heart â€“ a love affair that&amp;rsquo;s been burning bright for eight years.</description>
